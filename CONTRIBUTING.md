## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We aim to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues before creating a new one
- Provide detailed information about the problem
- Include steps to reproduce if applicable
- Specify which Docker image is affected

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open an issue to discuss your idea first
- Explain the use case and benefits
- Consider security implications for testing-oriented images

## Adding a New Docker Image

When contributing a new Docker image, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Directory Structure

Create a new directory with a descriptive name:

```
custom-docker-images/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-image-name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile (or versioned dockerfiles)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (any additional files)
```

### 2. Dockerfile Requirements

- Use clear, well-commented Dockerfiles
- Pin base image versions for reproducibility
- Follow Docker best practices (multi-stage builds, layer optimization)
- Include appropriate LABEL metadata:

  ```dockerfile
  LABEL maintainer="your-email@example.com"
  LABEL version="1.0"
  LABEL description="Brief description of the image"
  ```

### 3. Documentation Standards

Each image directory must include a `README.md` with:

#### Required Sections

- **About** - Purpose and use case
- **Prerequisites** - Required tools and knowledge
- **Quick Start** - Condensed commands for experienced users
- **Build Instructions** - Step-by-step build process
- **Usage Instructions** - How to run and use the image
- **Examples** - Concrete usage examples
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

#### Optional but Recommended

- Version comparison table
- Security notices/warnings
- References and links
- Cleanup instructions

#### Example Template

```markdown
## About
[Description and purpose]

## Quick Start
[One-liner or short command sequence]

## Prerequisites
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

## Build Instructions
[Step-by-step guide]

## Usage
[How to use the image]

## Examples
[Concrete examples]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues]
```

### 4. Versioning

- Use semantic versioning for image tags
- Provide separate Dockerfiles for different versions if needed
- Clearly document version differences

### 5. Security Considerations

- **If the image is intentionally insecure** (for testing):
  - Add prominent warnings in the README
  - Include `‚ö†Ô∏è Testing only - not for production` status
  - Document the security implications
  
- **For production-ready images**:
  - Follow security best practices
  - Keep dependencies updated
  - Document any security considerations

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-image-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test your Docker image**:
   - Ensure it builds successfully
   - Test all documented commands
   - Verify on multiple platforms if possible (amd64, arm64)

4. **Update the root README.md**:
   - Add your image to the "Available Images" section
   - Follow the existing format

5. **Commit your changes** with clear commit messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add [image-name] for [use case]"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-image-name
   ```

7. **Pull request checklist**:
   - [ ] Dockerfile(s) follow best practices
   - [ ] README.md is comprehensive and follows template
   - [ ] Root README.md is updated
   - [ ] Image builds successfully
   - [ ] All commands in documentation have been tested
   - [ ] Security warnings included (if applicable)
